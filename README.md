# 2. Overview
## 2.1 Aim
The project aims to address the challenges associated with manual, time-consuming, and error-prone regulatory reporting and compliance processes within financial institutions. The system being developed will facilitate the efficient identification of compliance risks and ensure that financial institutions can adapt quickly to regulatory changes without significant manual intervention.
## 2.2 Objective
1. To research and understand the regulatory environment and reporting requirements for financial institutions.
2. To design and develop a machine learning-driven system for automating regulatory reporting processes.
3. To create an analytics model capable of identifying potential compliance risks based on historical data.
4. To develop predictive analytics capabilities for forecasting potential compliance issues.
5. To implement an automated report generation module that adheres to the formatting and submission requirements of various regulatory bodies.
6. To validate the system's accuracy and efficiency through real-world scenario testing.
7. To document the system's development process, model methodologies, and the efficacy of the analytics in enhancing regulatory compliance.
